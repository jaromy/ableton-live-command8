The files in this folder implement a Remote MIDI Script for the Command|8 control surface for use in Ableton Live 8. It allows the Command|8 to be used as a control surface in Ableton Live, and provides some automatic default mappings - no manual assignments are needed.

It has been tested with v02.01.02 of the Command|8 firmware, and v8.4.2 of Ableton Live.


The basic mappings are as follows:
	Fader Volume, Ch 1-8
	Mute, Ch 1-8
	Solo, Ch 1-8
	Pan, Ch 1-8
	Select - Clip Launch, Ch 1-8

Additional mappings will be made available in the future
